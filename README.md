# odin-recipes
This project required us to use our knowledge of some basic HTML elements. The goal is to create a recipe webpage with at least 3 relative recipe links on the index page and 3 individual pages for the recipes of our choice.
Successful completion required the use of relative links, images, separate paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and the use of Git and Github.
