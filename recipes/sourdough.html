            <li>Mix the salt, wheat flour, and all purpose flour together.</li>

            <li>Mix together until there are no pieces of dry flour.</li>
            <li>Cover and let rest for 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Every 30 minutes do a series of stretch and folds.</li>
            <li>After a series of 3 stretch and folds, cover and let rest until the dough has approximately doubled.</li>
            <li>Split the dough into 2 equal parts and form into tight balls. Place in bannetons and put in the refrigerator to cold ferment 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li>Place a Dutch Oven in the oven and heat your oven at 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes.</li>
