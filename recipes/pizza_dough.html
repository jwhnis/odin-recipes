        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1200 grams flour</li>
            <li>850 grams water</li>
            <li>20 grams salt</li>
            <li>5 grams dried yeast</li>
            <li>5 grams honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The evening before you plan to make pizza mix 200 grams of water, 200 grams flour, the yeast and honey. Mix well and place in fridge. This is called a poolish.</li>
            <li>Place 650 grams of water in your mixing bowl along with the poolish. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and add in the rest of the flour.</li>
            <li>If using a mixer like a Kitchen Aid, knead the dough for 6-8 minutes. If mixing by hand knead for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After kneading the dough, form into a large ball, cover and let double in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has doubled, form into seperate dough balls. Each dough ball should weigh a minimum of 250 grams.</li>
            <li>Let the dough balls rest for at least an hour before using, or place in the fridge for up to 48 hours.</li>
        </ol>
